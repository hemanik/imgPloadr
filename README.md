An example web application from the 
[book](https://github.com/twang281314/frontEnd/blob/master/book/Web%20Development%20with%20MongoDB%20and%20NodeJS%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf) 
that is build using Node.js is a clone of a popular social image-sharing
site, imgur.com . The site will be called imgPloadr.io.

**Designing the web application**

The requirements of the site are as follows:

* The home page will allow visitors to upload an image as well as browse the
existing uploads, which will be ordered based on newest to oldest.

* Each uploaded image will be presented via its own page that shows its title,
description, and a large image display. Visitors will be able to like the image
and post comments.

* A consistent shared sidebar will be visible on both pages and will showcase
some general statistics about the site, the most popular images, and the most
recent comments.
The site will use Bootstrap, so that it has a nice professional design and is responsive
on any device.
